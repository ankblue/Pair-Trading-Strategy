# ðŸ“ˆ Kalman Filter-Based Statistical Arbitrage Strategy

This project implements a dynamic **pair trading strategy** using a **Kalman Filter** to estimate time-varying hedge ratios between co-integrated stock pairs. Unlike traditional static linear regression, this approach adapts to changing market regimes using a **state-space model**, enhancing responsiveness and trading signal accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Strategy Overview

- **Objective:** Generate alpha by exploiting the mean-reverting relationship between two co-integrated stocks.
- **Technique:** Use a **Kalman Filter** to dynamically estimate the hedge ratio (Î²) and intercept, forming a spread that adapts over time.
- **Signal Generation:** Apply **Z-score normalization** on the filtered spread to generate **Buy/Sell/Exit** signals based on predefined thresholds.
- **Risk Management:** Includes **position sizing**, **stop-loss**, and **take-profit** mechanisms.
